\section{Raw layer}
\label{sec:raw-layer}

NAF document can encode a ``raw'' layer with the actual document to be
processed. This layer is entirely optional, and is encoded as a
\texttt{CDATA} section.

Given this input document:
\begin{quote}
  John taught mathematics 20 minutes every Monday in New York.

  He liked it a lot!
\end{quote}

The NAF raw layer would look like:
\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small]
  <raw><![CDATA[John taught mathematics 20 minutes every Monday in New York.

He liked it a lot!]]>
  </raw>
\end{verbatim}
